--3. Get the ids and names of customers who did not place an order through agent a03.                                                  
 
select cid, name
from customers
where cid not in (select cid
			  from orders
			  where aid = 'a03'

--5. Get the ids of products not ordered by any customers who placed any order through agent 
--a08 in pid order from highest to lowest.

select distinct pid
from orders
where cid not in (select cid
			   from orders
			   where aid = 'a08'

--8. Check constraints specifies a requirement that must be met by each row in a datbase table. Check constraints 
--are expressed through predicates. It can refer to a single column or mutiple columns. The result of the 
--predicates can be true, false, and unknown if the value is null. One such applications of check constraints
--is to avoid negative values in columns that contextually do not use negatives. A bad such example of using
--check constraints include setting a maximum on price or having restraints that rely on incmplete data or other 
--tables. Check constraints are usally used to ensure the validity of data in a database and provide data 
--integrity. It used with applications that use the database in order to maintain valid data even though the 
--applications allow invalid data.
